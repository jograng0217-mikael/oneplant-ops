## 🚀 Deployment (One-Shot Guide)

To make sure your page works immediately on GitHub Pages, follow these exact steps:

1.  **Repository Setup**: Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  **Upload Files**: Upload **only the contents** of this folder directly to the root of your repository.
    - Your repository should look like this (no subfolders):
      ```text
      /
      ├── index.html
      ├── style.css
      ├── main.js
      └── README.md
      ```
3.  **Enable Pages**: 
    - Go to **Settings > Pages**.
    - Under "Build and deployment", set Source to **Deploy from a branch**.
    - Select your branch (usually `main`) and the folder as `/(root)`.
    - Click **Save**.

Your site will be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/` within a minute!
